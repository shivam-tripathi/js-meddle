# JS-Meddle

================================================================================

Code written while meddling with js es6 and react.

Run the following to transpile ES6 via babel and run the server.
```shell
npm run buildrun
```

Alternatively, you can run the following to clear transpiled code and build:
```
npm run clean
npm run build
```

To rerun the server, simply enter the following in the command line:
```
npm start
```
